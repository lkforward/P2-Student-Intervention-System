    "**Answer: **\n",
    "(1) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric method, which does not require assumptions on the underlying distribution of the data (reference 1). KNN is good for applications where people have little knowledge about the structure of the data. A shortcoming of KNN is that it is sensitive to local structure of data, noise or redundent features (reference 2). It is often used for similarity-based classification or regression. One application of KNN is recommendation system, where items are recommended based on how similar they are to customers' choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset has only 300 data samples, which might not be sufficient to train very complex models. KNN doesn't have any assumption on a specific distribution or require large amount of data, and thus could be a good fit for this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree is a simple and effective tool for rule-based classification. While most of the classifiers require numeric data, decision trees can handle both numeric and categorical data. There are some limitations of decision tree classifier. For example, it tends to get over-complex to fit every variation in the data and cause over-fitting. If the data is unbalanced, it generates biased tree. But these problems can be mitigated with a careful design of the learning algorithm (reference 3). Decision tree has been used in many different fields. For instance, Set-Enumeration (SE) trees were used by NASA scientists to automatically catelogue and characterize satellite imagery. More examples can be found at (reference 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree is widely applicable, and in addition, it is easy to understand and to interpret that will help the educator better understand the reasons responsible for studying problems. Therefore, decision tree is selected as a candidate model for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Random Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest classifier can improve the accuracy of single decision trees. And in addition, it is able to deal with unbalanced data or missing values and it runs very fast compared with other complicated classifiers. The weakness of random forests is when used for regression, they can't predict beyong the range of training data and in some cases, it tends to overfit the data (https://citizennet.com/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest classifier has a broad spectrum of applications in practice. In bioinformatics, it was used to identify diseases associated genes from genome wide association studies (reference 6). In computer vision, it is used in head pose estimation for real time face analysis (reference 7). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is characterized by its limited data size and high-dimensional features. As the random forest classifier has its own advantages in dealing with small but high-dimensional dataset efficiently, it is provided as an alternative model for this problem. \n"

You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F<sub>1</sub> score.

    "The number of data samples in this project is not very large (only 300 in the training set), but it is enough for the selected algorithms which are relatively simple and don't require large amount of data for training. In terms of model performance, both decision tree and random forest can achieve nearly perfect F1 score for the training data. For the test data, which is separated from the training process, the three classifiers have very close F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a \"lazy\" learner, KNN needs very little training time but it takes a relatively longer time for prediction as it does most of its computation when a new test data comes. In contrast, the decision tree and the random forest classifier take longer time for training but they are both very efficient in the prediction phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the decision tree and its ensemble version (random forest) have an advantage in interpretability, which is valable for the educators to gain more insights from the data. Since ensembling could help improve the model accuracy and reduce over-fitting, random forest is chosen as the \"best\" model at this point. \n",

    "Random forest is an ensemble method to use several simple classifiers called \"decision tree\" to make a prediction whether a student will pass or fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each single decision tree takes historical data on many students' performance (\"graduate\" or \"fail\") as well as their background information (called \"features\") and learns to make predictions just like an experienced teacher does. In this case, we have 30 such features, including their age, sex, their family size and so on, and the decision tree model could figure out which feature carries more weight in determining the success of a students based on how different the successful students and the students with difficulty are in this aspect, and makes a prediction for any new coming students with the necessary background information. \n",
    "\n",
    "A \"random forest\" is a \"forest\" of multiple decision trees. Just like a committee of professors could make a better judgement of a student's academic performance than a single professor does, the benefit of using a \"forest\" is that it could take into account the overall knowledge learnt through each single tree, and therefore it is less likely to make an error.

    "After tuning the model by grid search, the F1 score of the random forest for training and testing is 0.8571 and 0.7862, compared to 0.9976 and 0.7344 before tuning. The F1 score shows that the tuning process improved the model's performance in general situation (an increased F1 score for testing data) and reduced over-fitting (a smaller difference in training and testing). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, the random forest classifer only slightly outperforms the decision tree after tuning. But it is worth mentioning that this F1 score is only calculated from a random training/testing split. Considering the size of this dataset is limited, cross-validation should give a more complete evaluation of the performance of various classifiers. Among all the 48 numeric features, there also might be some redundency. The decision tree / random forest classifier provides information (gini or entropy) about the relative importance of different features, which could be useful to reduce feature redundency for further learning process.
